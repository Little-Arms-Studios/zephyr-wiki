# 🎮 Supported Controllers

{% hint style="info" %}
There may be compatible controllers not on this list. We are actively testing and adding support for popular controllers and newer Mac computers. If your controller is not currently supported please check back on this page as it updates or reach out to support@littlearms.com
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Unfortunately Most DJI Controllers are not compatible with Zephyr at this time. They have not given third parties like us a good way to read the output from their controllers. We hope this will change in the future.

Zephyr supports other controllers that use OpenTX; however, they may require rebinding the inputs inside of the Zephyr program. This is only recommended for advanced users.
