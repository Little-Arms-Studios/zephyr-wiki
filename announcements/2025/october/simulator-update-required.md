# Simulator Update Required

Dear valued Zephyr customer,

## What's happening?

On October 3rd, 2025, Unity (the game engine we use to power the Zephyr simulation) notified all developers that a vulnerability was discovered and patched. This patch requires a rebuild of all applications and an update to be applied to end users.

From Unity:

> There is no evidence of any exploitation of the vulnerability nor has there been any impact on users or customers.
>
> Unity has worked in close collaboration with our platform partners who have taken further steps to secure their platforms and protect end users.

Consumer Guidance:

> Keep your devices and applications updated, enable automatic updates, and maintain current antivirus software

Little Arms Studios' Commitment:

> We take all security matters very seriously and work as diligently as possible to resolve and protect against vulnerabilities such as these. We constantly monitor security advisories for all of our tools and regularly apply updates especially those with security fixes. Keeping your Little Arms Launcher and Zephyr Simulator up to date ensures that you have the latest and most secure version of our software.

## What's next?

The next simulator update on {October XX, 2025} will include this security patch. We advise you to perform this update as soon as possible.

If you manage a lab of computers or group of organization computers, we advise you to apply and distribute these updates as soon as they are available.
