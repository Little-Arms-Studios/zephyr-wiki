# Email Verification Update

## What's New?

Starting **November 5th, 2025** all users (**with one exception\***) will be required to verify their email to continue using Zephyr.

If your email is not already verified, the next time you login to Zephyr (either through the website or the Launcher) you will be prompted to enter a code that's automatically sent to your email.

Once your email is verified you're good to go! We won't bother you with another email verification unless you update your email associated with your Zephyr account.

## What's the one exception?\*

Some K12 organizations do not allow access to their students' inboxes. For these organizations, student accounts will not be required to go through this verification process.

If you're unsure if your organization on Zephyr is setup to as K12, please reach out to support@littlearms.com.

## What if I don't have access to my inbox?

Please contact support by sending an email to support@littlearms.com.

## I did not receive a verification code

Please check your spam and deleted folders in your inbox.

You can also click "Resend" on the email verification code window in Zephyr.

If you still have not received a code, please send an email to support@littlearms.com.
