<summary>Who should use Zephyr?</summary>

Anyone who is seeking to improve their drone flight skills or receive training for a specific industry. For more information on the features Zephyr has to offer please reference our [features](https://zephyr-sim.com/features).\
\
Zephyr was designed from the ground up to be a training tool for growing real world skills. The enterprise version includes the Learning Management System meant to be used in classroom, workforce development, and training program environments. It is also great for businesses to track simulated flight times and scores of internal and contracted operators.

<summary>Is there a demo available for Zephyr?</summary>

We offer a free option for individual accounts [here](https://zephyr-sim.com/individuals). We also offer a risk-free trial to enterprises that would like to explore the advantages of incorporating Zephyr into their training operations. Interested parties may request a demo by contacting us at [contact@littlearms.com](mailto:contact@littlearms.com).

<summary>I run a training program, what can Zephyr do for me?</summary>

The learning management system (LMS) is a highly effective tool that can be utilized to increase operational efficiency of your training program. Using our web portal in combination with Zephyr Drone Simulator, instructors and operators can view data on the flights of both individuals and entire classes. More information on the features Zephyr has to offer can be found on our [features](https://zephyr-sim.com/features).\
\
Zephyr can save you both time and money by allowing you to track student progress without having to look over their shoulder. It also reduces the chances of drones being destroyed or damaged in training through operator error. Zephyr was designed to allow many students to go through training at one time, so if you have a limited number of drones that can be flown at one time, Zephyr is a great way to allow students to train as they prepare and cycle through using the physical drones. \
\
Using Zephyr also increases both instructor confidence in their students and student confidence in themselves since they will have a better foundation for how to fly and control a drone than if they jump straight into trying to fly expensive equipment in the field.

<summary>I get a "Failed to Load Mono" error when trying to launch Zephyr; how do I fix this?</summary>

The "Failed to Load Mono" error when launching Zephyr is usually the result of corrupted files during the download or installation process.

1. Click the button with the 3 dots to the right of the "Launch" button on the Zephyr tab to access the options.
2. Select "Scan and Repair" This will run for a moment and clear out corrupted files. Wait for the process to finish
3. Once it completes, you should be able to click the Launch button and use Zephyr as expected

<summary>Mobile Controller Questions</summary>

Due to limited use and frequent issues, we have decided to end support for the mobile controller. If you currently use the mobile controller, you may continue to do so, but it will likely be phased out in future updates. As such, we will not be able to offer any support or troubleshooting if you encounter issues.

</details>

<details>

<summary>When is "X" feature coming to Zephyr?</summary>

Zephyr is a constantly growing and evolving training platform. We take user and customer feedback very seriously and do everything we can to make Zephyr the best drone training tool possible. If you have feedback or specific features you or your institution requires please contact us at [support@littlearms.com](mailto:support@littlearms.com).

We have also worked with schools and businesses to create content specifically for their students, employees and customers through a software development agreement. Please contact our sales team if you are interested at [sales@littlearms.com](mailto:sales@littlearms.com).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I change the controls setup in Zephyr?</summary>

Yes, users are able to configure the controller/transmitter to any configuration from the available channels. In the simulator there is a calibration and mapping menu where users can customize inputs to their liking.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Does Zephyr incorporate mission planning/autopilot?</summary>

Zephyr does not currently contain any auto-pilot features or mission planning. Some drone models have obstacle avoidance which can be activated.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What types of specific training are offered?</summary>

All of the modules are built strategically to provide effective training in a progressive learning environment. As the user progresses through the scenarios and modules, each module encompasses the principles learned in previous objectives, increasing the knowledge retention of the user. In most modules, users can fly in different ways or styles and still be successful. As we develop Zephyr further, we will be adding more modules for specific industries such as cinematography, surveying, inspection, and modules for first responders.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do you fly in FPV or VLOS in Zephyr?</summary>

Both modes are displayed and accessible in Zephyr. By default, the camera can be switched in-flight by pressing the spacebar.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I log flight hours in Zephyr?</summary>

Zephyr logs flight time in the simulator, which is stored and can be accessed later online through the integrated learning management system. If you are idle for too long in the simulator, it will not count your report/flight time for that module. The simulator will notify you if this occurs. This is done to keep logged flight time meaningful and to accurately report the amount of time a user flies in the simulator.

We also have an optional integration with [Drone Logbook](https://wiki.zephyr-sim.com/integrations/drone-logbook) where you can send your reports automatically from Zephyr to the [Drone Logbook](https://wiki.zephyr-sim.com/integrations/drone-logbook) system to be included in your simulated flight time.

<details>

<summary>Is there a mobile version of Zephyr?</summary>

No, Zephyr is a PC and Mac based platform. There is a free mobile controller available for Zephyr, but this is simply a touch screen controller that can be connected via your internet network and does not run the entire simulator platform on the mobile device.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is Zephyr available in my country?</summary>

<summary>Why does the F1 key on my keyboard not work for Flight Mode Switching?</summary>

This issue is most often caused by Zephyr detecting an active-but-unreleased pressing of the Flight Mode Switch command, usually from a controller with toggle switches like the FS-i6s. This active input prevents Zephyr from reading the input of your F1 key, as the system reads that same command as already being entered. Setting the toggle switch to a neutral state will stop the Flight Mode Switch input, allowing the F1 input to work

Alternatively, setting the toggle switch to neutral and then returning it to the Flight Mode Switch position will achieve the same result as pressing F1 on your keyboard.
