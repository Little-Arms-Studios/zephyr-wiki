# Vertical Drift Fix on Controller

To fix the vertical drift or unintended elevation gain when yawing on a controller, please go through the following steps. **These steps will need to be repeated on any computer you fly on, as the settings are stored on the local machine, not on the controller.**

1. Navigate to the main menu in Zephyr
2. Click the Controller Menu
3. Click "Clear Calibration"
4. Click "Quick Calibration"
   1. Run through the Quick-Calibrate. This will have you move both sticks up and to the left at the same time, then both sticks down and to the right at the same time. Please follow the on screen instructions closely.
5. Now, still in the controller menu, on the right side, set both deadzone numbers to .05
   1.

7. You can now return to normal Zephyr operation. Again, these steps will need to be repeated on any additional computers you fly on.
