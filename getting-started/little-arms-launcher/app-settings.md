# App Settings

## Access App Settings

1. Login to the Launcher
2. On the application's home page, click the "Three Dot" icon next to the green pill-shaped button
3. Click "App Settings"
4. A window will open with the App's settings options

## App Management Options

### Automatically apply available updates

If this is toggled to "on," this will automatically download and apply updates when the Launcher detects they are available.&#x20;

If this is toggled to "off," then you will be prompted to update the application when it's available

### Enable selective version management

If this is toggled to "on," this will allow you to target specific releases of the application to install and run. If this is toggled to "off," then you will be encouraged to stay as up to date with the application as possible.

When this is toggled "on," you will get a dropdown arrow on your green pill-shaped "launch/update" button on the application's homepage.

Clicking the dropdown arrow will give you sub-menu options depending on some context. That context being, what version of the application is currently installed and what versions of the application are behind and ahead of the currently installed version. You may see both or either of these sub-menu options.

So, with this enabled, you can revert back or update to specific versions of the application if desired.
