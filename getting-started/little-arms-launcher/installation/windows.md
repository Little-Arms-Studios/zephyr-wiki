First you'll need to download the Little Arms Launcher which is used to install Zephyr and keep it up to date. &#x20;

Login by going to [https://zephyr-sim.com/login](https://zephyr-sim.com/login)

Once logged in and at the Dashboard, the top navigation bar will display an orange <mark style="color:orange;">**Get Zephyr**</mark> button.

Click it.

You will be prompted to select the prefered drive you'd like to use to install applications downloaded through the Little Arms Launcher.  By defualt this will be your `C` drive, if you'd like to keep Zephyr stored on a different drive you can choose to do so now.  It is also possible to do this later through the Settings section of the Little Arms Launcher.  If you are happy keeping Zephyr in the default `C` drive drive simply click Continue.
