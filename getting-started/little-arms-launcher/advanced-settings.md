# Advanced Settings

Advanced settings by default is hidden. If you need to access advanced settings, press **Ctrl + L** while using the Launcher.

If you are on the Sign In screen, you will see a new link at the bottom of the Sign In window called "Advanced Settings."

To hide the Advanced Settings tab, press **Ctrl + L** again to disable it.

## Remember Me

If you would like to disable the "Remember Me" option entirely for anyone that uses the Launcher, you can enable "Disable 'Remember Me'" under the Settings > Advanced tab.

When enabled, the "Remember Me" checkbox on Sign In will be disabled by default
