## Module Breakdowns

### Cones 1

Dolly forward and back over the cones, focusing straight and level flight with the nose oriented forward, and maintaining the same local heading.

### Cones 2

Track left and right over teh cones while maintaining the nose orientation forward, and fly smoothly side to side.  Make sure to watch the horizon to ensure level flight.

### Cones 3

Trace the square clockwise while tracking and dolly shots.  Make sure the drone is oriented in the same direction throughout the module. Practice making controlled yet square corners.

### Cones 4

Trace the square with the nose forward throughout the pattern, focus on turning the drone around the corners as smoothly as possible.
