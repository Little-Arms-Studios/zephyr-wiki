## Module Breakdowns

### Throttle Control

Begin learning to fly a drone by mastering the basics of throttle control.

### Pitch and Roll

Continue learning the basics of drone fight by learning pitch and roll

### Yaw

Continue learning how to fly a drone with the final major drone maneuver, adjusting the yaw.

### Horizontal Flight

Practice what you've learned by keeping the drone in the moving circle. Stay in the circle longer for a better score!

### Horizontal Flight with Throttle

A more challenging variant of Horizontal Flight, you will need to adjust the throttle of the drone as well as stay inside of the circle.

### Tour of the Course

It is almost time for the big race! Take a tour of the race course to see the different obstacles.

### Race Around the Course

Use all of your training flying drones to fly the race course in FPV mode.

### Game 01: Maze

Practice flying your drone through a complex maze.

### Game 02: Pass Through the Wall

Maneuver your drone through the holes in the shapes to score points. Don't hit the walls or go too far outside the course or you will lose a life!

### Game 03: Ball Collector
