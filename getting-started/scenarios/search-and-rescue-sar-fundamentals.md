### Glideslope 01&#x20;

Glideslope is a technique used by industry professionals to fly forwards and descend in altitude simultaneously for a more efficient and smoother flight all while keeping your camera focused on an intended target. You will fly indicated routes while facing a specific direction to practice this advanced technique.&#x20;

### Zoom Reveal 01&#x20;

Zoom Reveal is the inverse movement of Glideslope. You will fly backwards and gain altitude simultaneously while keeping your camera on an intended target. This technique is often used in search and rescue applications to not lose sight of a subject while returning home or reorienting yourself with your environment. You will fly indicated routes while facing a specific direction to practice this advanced technique.&#x20;
