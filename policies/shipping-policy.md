# Shipping Policy

## Shipment Processing Time

All orders are processed within 2-3 business days. Orders are not shipped or delivered on weekends or holidays.

If we are experiencing a high volume of orders, shipments may be delayed by a few days. Please allow additional days in transit for delivery. If there will be a significant delay in shipment of your order, we will contact you via email or telephone.

## Shipping Rates & Delivery Estimates

Shipping charges for your order will be calculated and displayed at checkout.

Delivery delays can occasionally occur.

## Shipment to P.O. boxes

Our shipping partners may not be able to ship to P.O. boxes. Contact sales@littlearms.com if you require shipping to a P.O. box.

## Shipment confirmation & Order tracking

You will receive a Shipment Confirmation email once your order has shipped containing your tracking number(s). The tracking number will be active within 24 hours.

## Customs, Duties and Taxes

The Zephyr Team is not responsible for any customs and taxes applied to your order. All fees imposed during or after shipping are the responsibility of the customer (tariffs, taxes, etc.).

## Damages

The Zephyr Team is not liable for any products damaged or lost during shipping. That said, our team is happy to assist you if any issues occur. We will work with you and the shipping service provider to get your issue resolved as quickly as possible.

Please save all packaging materials and damaged goods before filing a claim.
