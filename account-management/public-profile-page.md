# Public Profile Page

Zephyr provides users a way to display and link to their public profile. Disabled by default, you can **enable your public profile** by:

1. Logging in to your account on zephyr-sim.com
2. Click your profile picture to summon the User Settings window
3. Click "Public Profile"
4. Toggle "Enable Public Profile" to "ON"

**To edit and view your public profile settings**, click "View Public Profile" under the User Settings/Public Profile pane or click "Public Profile" underneath the profile picture on your dashboard.

### Privacy Settings

* First Name: displays the user's first name on the public profile page
* Last Name: displays the user's last name on the public profile page
* Email: displays the user's email on the public profile page
* Certifications: displays the user's certifications (if applicable) on the public profile page

Note: when you enable/disable a privacy setting, you must click "Apply Changes" for the change to take effect on your live page.

### Live Page

To view your live page, click the "View Live" button under "Actions."&#x20;

To share your live profile, simply visit your "Manage Public Profile" page and copy the URL from your browser. The structure should look like `https://zephyr-sim.com/public-profile/{Random_ID}`

You can share this URL with anyone and they can view your public profile page. If you decide to stop sharing your profile, simply return to the User Settings/Public Profile pane from your zephyr-sim.com dashboard and set the "Enable Public Profile" toggle to "OFF."

### **Certifications**

The certifications section, if enabled, will display the user's certifications associated with their Zephyr account. A green check mark indicates that the certification is approved and in good standing.

From the "Manage Public Profile" view, the three options underneath each certification are:

* Go to [Verification Page](../certifications/verify-a-certification.md)
* Copy [Verification Page Link](../certifications/verify-a-certification.md)
* Copy Badge Embed Code

### Copy Badge Embed Code

This will summon a window that allows you to copy an HTML code snippet that will allow you to paste and display your certification page with a link to its verification page on your website or online profile that supports custom HTML snippets
