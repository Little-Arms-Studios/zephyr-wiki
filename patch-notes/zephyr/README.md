_This update includes a rework to the Tutorial scenario, a new flyable drone, and multiple squashed bugs._

**New Features ✨**

* Updated Scenarios
  * Tutorial
    * We split the Tutorial scenario into four smaller modules instead of one enormous module. This greatly improved performance and will allow users to access desired sections of the tutorial quicker.
    * We updated the environmental art of the tutorial, switching from an empty void to a furnished gymnasium. Even if you completed the original tutorial before, it is worth checking out the new flyable area.
    * We updated the scenario and module selection art to reflect the environmental art changes.
* New Flyable Drones
  * DJI Matrice 30
    * The Matrice 30 from DJI is respected and trusted commercial drone model. Portable, rugged, and powerful, the Matrice 30 (M30) has nearly as many use cases as it does users.
* New Authorization System
  * Integrated Zephyr’s authorization system with new authorization system featured on the Zephyr website.
