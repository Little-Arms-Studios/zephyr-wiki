### October 23, 2025

_This update includes two new scenarios "Miami Beach" and "SAR Fundamentals" (Search and rescue) with 17 modules total. It also includes a major flight physics overhaul impacting every drone in the simulator for better flight accuracy. The Capture system has also had a major under-the-hood update that should allow for more accurate captures, multi-target captures, and zoom being factored in._
