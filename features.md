# Features

## Accurate Physics

Zephyr's physics models have been meticulously crafted to accurately reflect what you'd experience in reality. Each drone is individually modeled from its real-world measurements in order to provide a seamless experience when transitioning from simulator to real flight.

## Wind

Zephyr's robust wind system is generally available in all scenarios. Direction and strength of the wind varies based on various conditions and will react to structures creating dynamic situations perfect for you to practice.

Some scenarios, like Bridge Inspection, have more dynamic or stronger wind effects depending on the module selected.

To turn the wind system on/off, go to the settings menu in a scenario and toggle it to your desired setting. (Note: if wind is required for a module, it will still be present if wind is toggled off)

## Weather System

A more dynamic weather system can be turned on or off from the main menu. This will introduce better cloud coverage and precipitation based on a variety of factors like location and module. Check the scene and module descriptions to learn more about the types of weather available in each.

## Thermal Camera

_coming soon_

## Payload System

Currently, Zephyr supports two payload types, camera and flashlight. _Coming soon_, Zephyr is expanding its payload system to support current real world applications. Stay tuned!
