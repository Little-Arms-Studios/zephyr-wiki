# Data Removal

We understand that every institution has different needs when it comes to the retention of data. If our platform does not offer mechanisms that fit your needs, please let us know by contacting support@littlearms.com.

## Data Deletion Options

As always, you can request that your own account be deleted, but currently only Zephyr Admins can **delete organizations, courses, and students.**

If you need an **organization, course, and/or student accounts** to be deleted from Zephyr, please contact support@littlearms.com.

## FAQs

### What's deleted?

When an **organization** is deleted, all courses, assignments, licenses, and roles associated with that organization are deleted from the platform.

When a student account is deleted, their flight reports can optionally be included if this is required.

### How long after my delete request is made will the data be fully removed from the platform?

For non-user account data, the data is removed immediately from the platform. Backup data will be purged in accordance with our [data retention policy](../../privacy-and-security/privacy-statement/#retention-of-data).

For user accounts, when a delete request is submitted, all students at the organization will receive an email notifying them that their account will be deleted in 30 days. In this email, we give them an opportunity to save their account. If a student does not take action in 30 days, their account (and potentially their flight data) will be removed from the platform. Backup data will be purged in accordance with our [data retention policy](../../privacy-and-security/privacy-statement/#retention-of-data).
