## 1. Create Your Course

In order to invite students, you need to [create a course](courses.md) in Zephyr.

## 2. Invite Your Student(s)

You will still need to invite your students **by their SSO email** to the course you created in Step 1

Your students will receive an email invite with instructions to register their account (if they don't already have a Zephyr account)

### **Your students will need to either:**

#### **\[A] Register through email invite:**

1. **Click "Register" in the invite email**
2. **Instruct them to choose their relevant "Continue with X" SSO option (pictured below)**
3. Finish logging in to your SSO provider
4. You will be redirected back to your Zephyr dashboard
