# Courses

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to invite students to your institution, you need to have an active course running. This means a course who’s end date has not passed.
{% endhint %}

## Create a Course

{% hint style="info" %}
Only Instructors and Institution Admins can create courses
{% endhint %}

Navigate to your Zephyr dashboard

There are two ways to get to the “Create a Course” interface:

1. Click the “CREATE COURSE” button on your dashboard’s quick-links section
2. Click “MANAGE” > “COURSES” to drop down the courses table. Then click the “Plus” symbol in the Courses table toolbar

Four fields are required for creating a course:

* Name: The title of the course that will appear to users throughout the website

{% hint style="info" %}
Course Name does not have to be unique, but we encourage you to give it a unique name so it’s easy to recognize in a list of many courses
{% endhint %}

* Teacher: Select an existing Instructor or Institution Admin that will be running the course. They will appear as the primary point of contact to students
* Start Date: Date the course will begin
* End Date: Date the course will end

## Clone / Copy a Course

{% hint style="info" %}
Only Instructors and Institution Admins can clone or copy a course
{% endhint %}

Navigate to your Zephyr dashboard

For the purposes of this example, we’ll call the course that we frequently reuse “Intro to Drones.” If you find yourself reusing the same course and assignments from course to course, it’s helpful to create it and give it a name such as “Intro to Drones \[TEMPLATE].”

Now that your have your “TEMPLATE” course created, you can copy a course and all of its assignments by following instructions here: [Copy a Course (and Assignments)](https://littlearms.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZW/pages/2430664707)

During this process you can reassign the instructors, change the start/end dates, and even tweak assignments.

## Edit a Course

{% hint style="info" %}
Only Instructors and Institution Admins can edit a course
{% endhint %}

Navigate to your Zephyr dashboard

Click “MANAGE” > “COURSES” to drop down the courses table

Find the course you need to edit in the table

Click the “Cog” icon on the course, then click Edit

Here you can change the course fields as needed

When you are finished, click “Update”
