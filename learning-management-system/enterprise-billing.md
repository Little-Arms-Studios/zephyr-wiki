# Enterprise Billing

We offer three different billing solutions in order to satisfy the different needs for our clients.

## Site Licensing

Site Licensing is a type of licensing offered on Zephyr that allows institution the freedom to assign/un-assign/reassign licenses to their users as needed!

The way it works, your institution pays for a certain number of site licenses (let’s say 10 in this example). Depending on your billing cycle (let’s say 1 year in this example), you will be able to assign those 10 licenses to anyone at your institution for 1 year.

Once your institution is created and you have admin access, you can invite as many instructors or students as you would like. Inviting them and having them register their accounts does _not_ use a site license. So, you can prepare your course, invite your students, they can register, and then you can assign them licenses whenever the course begins.

If you need to add licenses mid-cycle, you can request licenses to be added through the site (or by reaching out to [sales@littlearms.com](mailto:sales@littlearms.com)). You will pay a prorated rate for your new licenses and they will then roll over into your next cycle.

When your cycle approaches 30 days from the end, you will receive an automated email notification. A Zephyr representative may reach out in the next couple of days to discuss renewal. You can also reach out to us at any point to discuss renewal by emailing [sales@littlearms.com](mailto:sales@littlearms.com).

If you choose not to renew, we’d love to hear why or have the opportunity to discuss your options for renewal. But ultimately, if you decide not to renew, then your licenses will expire at the end of your billing cycle (plus a few extra days that we give them by default).

If you choose to renew, then you’ll receive an invoice from us after discussing renewal options with a team member. Once the invoice is paid you don’t need to do anything else! If you requested an increase or decrease in license number, these licenses will be available to you immediately and you can continue using Zephyr normally.

## Legacy Pricing

### Bill Me Later

Bill Me Later is an on demand licensing solution offered to organizations that need to add seats on an as needed basis throughout a billing period.  They are then invoiced at the end of the billing period for the quantity seats they added during that billing period. &#x20;

### Point of Transaction

Point of Transaction is another on demand licensing solution offered to organizations that prefer to pay for the seats at the time they are needed.  The selected quantity of seats are added after finishing the checkout process.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Both Bill Me Later and Point of Transaction Seats are deducted from the organization when an invite is sent to a Student to join the organization.  If the invitation is deleted before it was accepted, the seat is reimbursed to the organization.  If the invitation is deleted after it was accepted, the seat will not be reimbursed.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Both Bill Me Later Seats and Point of Transaction Seats are NOT transferable between Users.&#x20;
