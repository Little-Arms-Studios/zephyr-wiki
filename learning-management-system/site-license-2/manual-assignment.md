# Manual Assignment

This style of license assignment under a site license organization allows institution admins and instructors to freely assign and remove licenses on student accounts at any time.

## Allocating Licenses

In order for students to gain access to scenarios in the simulator, **you must assign them a site license after they register to your Zephyr organization.**&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Students are **NOT** automatically assigned a site license when they register.
{% endhint %}

To access the "assign licenses" window:

1. Login to your institution admin or instructor account on [zephyr-sim.com](https://zephyr-sim.com)
2. On your dashboard, click "Assign" on the "LICENSES" card
