# Site License

## Overview

Site Licensing is a type of licensing offered on Zephyr that allows users to be assigned to or removed from a license. Think of it like a "seat" that someone can sit in. Only one person can sit in the seat at a time. If another person needs the seat, they can simply swap (swapping is done either [manually](manual-assignment.md) or [automatically](automatic-assignment.md)).

To begin, your institution pays for a certain number of student site licenses (let’s say 10 in this example). Depending on your billing cycle (let’s say 1 year in this example), you will be able to assign those 10 licenses to any student at your institution for 1 year.

Your institution will also have a max number of institution admin and instructor licenses they can use (let's says 1 max institution admin and 2 max instructor licenses in this example). **Institution admins and instructors will&#x20;**_**always**_**&#x20;have a license assigned to them upon accepting their invite. This means that you&#x20;**_**cannot**_**&#x20;invite more institution admins or instructors than your organization's license max respectively.**

In the example above, if you are currently the institution admin at your organization then you cannot invite more institution admins since your max institution admin license count is 1. If you already have 1 instructor registered at your organization, then you can only invite 1 more instructor since your max instructor license count is 2.

you need to remove the user from your organization (go to the Users table, click the cog icon in their row, and click "Remove User"). Once they are removed from your organization, an instructor license will be freed up so you may invite another instructor.

<summary><em>"How do I swap institution admins?"</em></summary>

only Zephyr Admins can remove institution admins from an organization. You need to reach out to your account manager or sales@littlearms.com to request an institution admin be removed from the organization. Either you can invite a new institution admin (if your permissions and max institution admin license count allow it) or request it with your account manager.

## Billing

Site Licensing is billed annually in most cases. You will receive an invoice for the number of seats that you need throughout the billing cycle.

{% hint style="info" %}
During the onboarding process, we will discuss how many student, instructor, and institution admin licenses you anticipate needing.
{% endhint %}

If you need to add licenses mid-cycle, you can request additional licenses through the site (or by reaching out to [sales@littlearms.com](mailto:sales@littlearms.com)). You will pay a prorated rate for your new licenses, and these licenses will roll over into your next cycle.

When your cycle approaches 30 days from the end, you will receive an automated email notification. A Zephyr representative may reach out a couple days after to discuss renewal. You can also reach out to us at any point to discuss renewal by emailing [sales@littlearms.com](mailto:sales@littlearms.com).

If you choose not to renew, your licenses will expire at the end of your billing cycle (plus a few extra "grace" days we grant by default).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Should you choose _**not**_ to renew, we’d love to hear why or have the opportunity to discuss alternative options for renewal.
{% endhint %}

If you choose to renew, you’ll receive an invoice from us after discussing renewal options with a team member. Once the invoice is paid, you don’t need to do anything else! If you requested an increase or decrease in license number, these licenses will be available to you immediately and you can continue using Zephyr normally.

## Allocating Licenses

Please refer to either the [manual-assignment.md](manual-assignment.md "mention") or [automatic-assignment.md](automatic-assignment.md "mention") page for details about your licensing method.

## License Expiration

Site licenses expire at the end of your billing period (plus a few days grace period).

License expiration will renew for the next billing cycle after your invoice is generated and paid.

If you choose to not renew, licenses will still expire at the end of your current billing period.

## Historical License Usage

You can always view your past license usage by logging in to your Institution Admin or Instructor account and clicking "View License Usage" under the "Site License Usage" card on your dashboard home page.

Historical license usage is captured every day at 12:00 UTC (07:00 EST). A snapshot of license usage is taken for each organization.
