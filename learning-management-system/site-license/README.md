# Site License

## Overview

Site Licensing is a type of licensing offered on Zephyr that allows institutions the freedom to assign/un-assign/reassign licenses to their users as needed!

To begin, your institution pays for a certain number of site licenses (let’s say 10 in this example). Depending on your billing cycle (let’s say 1 year in this example), you will be able to assign those 10 licenses to anyone at your institution for 1 year.

Once your institution is created and you have admin access, you can invite as many instructors or students as you would like. **Inviting them and having them register their accounts does&#x20;**_**not**_**&#x20;use a site license.** So, you can prepare your course, invite your students, they can register, and then you can assign them licenses whenever the course begins.

## Billing

Site Licensing is billed annually in most cases. You will receive an invoice for the number of seats that you need throughout the billing cycle.

{% hint style="info" %}
During the onboarding process, we will discuss how many extra site licenses are needed based on your anticipated institution admins and instructors.
{% endhint %}

If you need to add licenses mid-cycle, you can request additional licenses through the site (or by reaching out to [sales@littlearms.com](mailto:sales@littlearms.com)). You will pay a prorated rate for your new licenses, and these licenses will roll over into your next cycle.

When your cycle approaches 30 days from the end, you will receive an automated email notification. A Zephyr representative may reach out a couple days after to discuss renewal. You can also reach out to us at any point to discuss renewal by emailing [sales@littlearms.com](mailto:sales@littlearms.com).

If you choose not to renew, your licenses will expire at the end of your billing cycle (plus a few extra "grace" days we grant by default).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Should you choose not to renew, we’d love to hear why or have the opportunity to discuss alternative options for renewal.
{% endhint %}

If you choose to renew, you’ll receive an invoice from us after discussing renewal options with a team member. Once the invoice is paid, you don’t need to do anything else! If you requested an increase or decrease in license number, these licenses will be available to you immediately and you can continue using Zephyr normally.

## Allocating Licenses

In order for users to gain access to scenarios in the simulator, **you must assign them a site license after they register to your Zephyr organization.**&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only Institution Admins may manage site licenses at this time.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Users are **NOT** automatically assigned a site license when they register. Institution admins, instructors, and students will **each need a license assigned if they need one.**
{% endhint %}

To access the "assign licenses" window:

1. Login to your institution admin account on [zephyr-sim.com](https://zephyr-sim.com)
2.  On your dashboard, click "Assign" on the "LICENSES" card

3. The "MANAGE INSTITUTION LICENSES" window will appear

**Section A**:&#x20;

* Shows your available and total licenses
* "Assign Available" - assign all available licenses to the currently filtered selection in Section C
* "Reset" - reset the license assignment to its original state when the window first opened

**Section B**:

* Allows you to filter down the list shown in Section C by:
  * Searching a name or email
  * Selecting a course
  * Selecting a role
* Shows the "Current License Holders"

**Section C**:

* List of all filtered users at the institution based on input from Section B

### Assign a License

To assign a license, find the user(s) from the list in Section C. Click their entry to select them, then click the "Update" button.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a user is signed in at the time of license assignment, they will need to sign out and sign in to see their license reflected on their account.
{% endhint %}

### Revoke a License

To revoke a license, find the user(s) from the list in Section C. Click their entry to unselect them and then click the "Update" button.

## License Expiration

Site licenses expire at the end of your billing period (plus a few days grace period).

License expiration will renew for the next billing cycle after your invoice is generated and paid.

If you choose to not renew, licenses will still expire at the end of your current billing period.
