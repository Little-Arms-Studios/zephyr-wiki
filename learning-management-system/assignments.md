# Assignments

## What are Assignments?

Assignments are a function of the Zephyr Learning Management System that allow course instructors to:&#x20;

* Require students to complete specific modules
* Set requirements for successful assignment completion
* Set a timeframe for assignment completion

## Creating an Assignment

In order to create an Assignment, please follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to your Zephyr dashboard
2. Click MANAGE > COURSES > The (⚙️) Cog icon next to your existing Course > "View"
3. From the COURSE page, click the ASSIGNMENTS section to expand it
4. Click the (+) Plus icon in the header of the table to summon the "Create Assignment" window (pictured below)

### The Assignment Creation Window

The Assignment Creation Window features five required fields and three optional ones.

#### Required Fields:

* Scene (what scenario the student will load to find the module)

{% hint style="info" %}
A scene must be selected before you can select a module
{% endhint %}

* Module (what module the student must complete for the assignment)

{% hint style="info" %}
A single module is required when creating an assignment. Currently, assignments only support **one** module at a time. We plan to add support for requiring multiple modules for a single assignment in a future update.
{% endhint %}

* Due Date (when the assignment is due)
* Start Date (when reports should start counting towards assignment completion)
* End Date (when reports should stop counting towards assignment completion. Typically this is the same as "Due Date;" however, this is available if you need to differentiate between the due date and when students should stop their attempts)

#### Optional Fields:

* Details (any instructions or messages you want to provide to the students pertaining to the assignment)
* Total Time (if you have a minimum time requirement, you can enforce this here. Multiple reports, or "runs," may be required to fulfill the minimum time requirement)
* Minimum Score (if you have a minimum score that the student must achieve in order for their report to count towards assignment completion)

## Student View & Workflow

Students are able to view Course Assignments by navigating to their Zephyr dashboard and checking the bottom of the page. All relevant assignments will appear in this table with each assignment's current "completion" status.

### Completing an Assignment

In order for a student to complete an assignment, they must:

1. Note the assignment requirements:
   1. Scene/Module
   2. Date Range
   3. Due Date
   4. Minimum Score (if applicable)
   5. Total Time (if applicable)
   6. Details (if applicable)
2. Go to their Little Arms Launcher
3. Login with their Zephyr student credentials
4. Click "Launch" on the Zephyr page
5. When prompted, select their Student role for the course that has the assignment issued
6. Navigate to the appropriate scenario and module
7. Complete the module while meeting meet the assignment requirements
8. When the student finishes their run (and they do not receive an error message stating their report could not be submitted), they may navigate back to the Zephyr-Sim.com website and refresh the page to see if their report satisfied the assignment requirements

{% hint style="info" %}
A future update will improve this process by limiting the needed "back and forth" between the simulator and website to check for assignment completion
{% endhint %}
