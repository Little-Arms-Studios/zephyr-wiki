<summary>Cannot read the ID of pilot in video</summary>

In the event you cannot verify the ID of the pilot in their submission video, you may request a copy of their ID via email. Zephyr does not support uploading, storing, or sharing ID images through the website.

<summary>Video format unrecognized or will not play</summary>

In the event that the submission video cannot be played through the pilot’s sharing platform of choice, you may download the video to attempt the review.

If your computer cannot natively play the video format, we recommend using[ VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) to try playing the video or converting the video using [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) to a recognized format.
