# ðŸ“š Overview

## What is it?

<mark style="color:orange;">**Zephyr Drone Simulator**</mark> now offers virtual certifications!

Our first certification is offered in partnership with the Airborne Public Safety Association [(APSA)](https://publicsafetyaviation.org/). APSA has developed an APSA-NIST Basic Proficiency Evaluation for Remote Pilot (BPERP) Certificate in accordance with the [NIST Open Lane Test Methods](https://www.nist.gov/el/intelligent-systems-division-73500/standard-test-methods-response-robots/aerial-systems/open-test) for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems. Zephyr offers a BPERP training scenario and Virtual Certification option, too.
