# 📝 Reviewer

## Signing up as a Reviewer <a href="#signing-up-as-a-reviewer" id="signing-up-as-a-reviewer"></a>

A Zephyr Administrator will send you an invite link to register on [zephyr-sim.com](http://zephyr-sim.com/) as a Reviewer.

If you already have a Zephyr account, a Zephyr Administrator will add the Reviewer role to your account. The next time you sign in on [zephyr-sim.com](http://zephyr-sim.com/) you will see a role select option in the navigation bar.

## Reviewer Dashboard <a href="#reviewer-dashboard" id="reviewer-dashboard"></a>

The Reviewer Dashboard shows a _Recent Activity_ and a _Reviews Completed_ card.

The _Recent Activity_ card will show any of your personal recent activity such as Zephyr SIM Reports as well as recent certifications that require attention.

The _Reviews Complete_ card will show the number of certifications that you have reviewed in a given month.

## Certifications Management <a href="#certifications-management" id="certifications-management"></a>

The most important dashboard page for a reviewer is the **Certifications** tab

On the **Certifications** tab, you will be able to manage and review certifications

The _My Certifications_ table displays certifications that you have personally purchased. This tab will be seldom used as a Reviewer.

The _Manage Certifications_ table is where the majority of Reviewer work is done

Certifications in the _Manage Certifications_ table can have the following statuses:

* **Reviewing** - certification is currently under review
* **Awaiting Review** - certification is ready to be reviewed
* **Awaiting Attempt** - certification is ready for user to submit an attempt
* **Awaiting Reattempt** - certification is ready for user to submit another attempt (if first attempt was denied)
* **Current** - certification is current
* **Denied** - certification is denied
* **Not Started** - certification has not been activated
* **Expired** - certification has expired
* **Revoked** - certification has been revoked
* **Suspended** - certification has been suspended

Depending on the certification’s status, you will have different options when clicking the gear icon. Regardless of status, though, you will have a “View” option where you can see details about the certification

## Reviewing a Certification <a href="#reviewing-a-certification" id="reviewing-a-certification"></a>

To review a certification, you will need to:

1. Login to [![](https://zephyr-sim.com/public/favicon-32x32.png)Zephyr](http://zephyr-sim.com/) to process the request
2. Click **Certifications** on the left-hand navigation menu
3. Click the **Manage Certifications** table to expand it
4. Find the certification in the table that you would like to review
   1. Its status should be **Awaiting Review**. If not, follow[ these instructions](https://littlearms.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZW/pages/2506424321?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiM2E1OWJmY2I4M2MxNGZjODgxNzU2OGExZGM5ZmI2OWMiLCJwIjoiYyJ9#certification-already-being-reviewed)
   2. Note: you may also claim certifications that are **Awaiting Attempt**. Under special circumstances, you may bypass the attempt submission process. For instance, if you live-proctor an attempt either in person or through a virtual meeting, you may bypass the attempt submission process. In the _notes_ field when you are approving or denying the certification, you will need to note these circumstances.
5. Click the “Cog” Icon for the Certification then click “Claim”

{% hint style="info" %}
“Claiming” a certification simply reserves that certification for you to review it. This prevents other Reviewers from reviewing the same certification
{% endhint %}

6. Once the Certification is Claimed, you will be able to summon the “Review Certification Attempt” window

7. Click the “View” button to open the user’s attempt in a separate window

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have issues viewing the video: Follow the FAQ instructions for [Video format unrecognized](https://littlearms.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZW/pages/2506424321?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiM2E1OWJmY2I4M2MxNGZjODgxNzU2OGExZGM5ZmI2OWMiLCJwIjoiYyJ9#format-unrecognized) and [Video link is private or taken down](https://littlearms.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZW/pages/2506424321?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiM2E1OWJmY2I4M2MxNGZjODgxNzU2OGExZGM5ZmI2OWMiLCJwIjoiYyJ9#private-link)
{% endhint %}

8. Once you review the user’s video attempt, you may mark the attempt as “Approve”, “Deny”, or “Reattempt”
   1. Approve - the attempt was sufficient to merit the certification
   2. Deny - the attempt was no sufficient to merit the certification
   3. Reattempt - the attempt was technically incorrect, but the reviewer is allowing the user to resubmit

{% hint style="info" %}
You **must** submit notes explaining why their attempt was denied
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You **must** submit notes explaining what was incorrect with their submission
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Allowing a reattempt still constitutes a single certification review
{% endhint %}
