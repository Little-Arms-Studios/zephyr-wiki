# 📘 Instructions

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need a webcam and a microphone in order to successfully record a certification attempt
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you already know how to record your screen and camera, you only need to follow **Steps 3, 4.4, 4.5, and 5.** Just make sure, whatever recording service you use, that you are recording **your camera** **and your screen at the same time**.
{% endhint %}

### Step 1: Create Zoom Account <a href="#step-1-create-zoom-account" id="step-1-create-zoom-account"></a>

If you do not have a Zoom account, create one. If you have a Zoom account, skip to Step 2

1. Visit [<img src="https://st1.zoom.us/zoom.ico" alt="" data-size="line"> One platform to connect | Zoom](https://www.zoom.com/) and sign up for a free account
2. Download and Install Zoom on that same computer that you have Zephyr installed.

### Step 2: Setup and Start Zoom Meeting <a href="#step-2-setup-and-start-zoom-meeting" id="step-2-setup-and-start-zoom-meeting"></a>

Start a Zoom meeting with yourself and start recording the meeting

1. Open Zoom and select “New Meeting”

&#x20;

3\. Ensure your microphone is working by selecting the dropdown arrow on the Microphone Icon, then selecting “Test Speaker & Microphone…” This will walk you through instructions to verify that your microphone and speakers are working properly

<figure><img src="blob:https://app.gitbook.com/967ade11-25a0-4c72-8a0a-97e52e0a355e" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

4\. Click “Share Screen” at the bottom of the Zoom call and select the “Desktop #” window that you will be using for Zephyr (in the example “Desktop 2” is where we will be running Zephyr)

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The Zephyr Simulator may be running on a different Desktop window than the one in the example image. Make sure the simulator will be running/visible in the selected Desktop window.

Zoom will highlight the border of the Desktop you will be sharing. Make sure the Zephyr simulator will be running in that window.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="success" %}
Your Zoom call window should automatically minimize and a Zoom Toolbar should appear next to a smaller window that displays your webcam video
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

5. Press the “… More” button on the Zoom Toolbar and select “Record”

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="success" %}
You should hear “Recording in progress” to verify that your meeting it being recorded
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For details on Zoom Recordings, refer to the Zoom Documentation here [Enabling and starting local recordings - Zoom Support](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Enabling-and-starting-local-recordings)
{% endhint %}

### Step 3: Attempt Your Certification <a href="#step-3-attempt-your-certification" id="step-3-attempt-your-certification"></a>

{% hint style="warning" %}
The recording should **only** include the **one** attempt showing you successfully completing the test
{% endhint %}

Now that your meeting is being recorded, introduce yourself, verify your identity, and attempt your certification run.

1. Address the camera and state:
   1. Your Name
   2. The Date and Time
   3. The Name of the Certification you are attempting
      1. For example: _“My name is John Smith. It is Thursday, May 26, 2022, 11:30am. I am attempting a Virtual BPERP Certification”_
2. Show the camera a form of identification that shows **your name** and **your** **photo**

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you have a blurred or other background effect in Zoom, you may need to disable it for the ID to show properly
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Feel free to hide any other information on your ID, but ensure that **your name** and **your photo** are visible to the camera
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

3. Launch Zephyr (if you have not already) and load the module that corresponds to the certification you are attempting

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have multiple displays, make sure Zephyr is running on the display that you shared in the Zoom call in Step 2.4
{% endhint %}

4. Fly through and complete the scenario. When you reach the report/score screen you may stop the Zoom recording by selecting the “… More” button on the Zoom Toolbar and selecting “Stop Recording”

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Your recording will not be processed and saved until you end the Zoom call
{% endhint %}

### Step 4: End Meeting and Save Your Certification Attempt <a href="#step-4-end-meeting-and-save-your-certification-attempt" id="step-4-end-meeting-and-save-your-certification-attempt"></a>

End the Zoom meeting, save the recording, review the recording, upload the recording, submit the attempt on Zephyr

1. End the Zoom meeting by pressing the “End” button then select “End Meeting for All”

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. Once you end the Zoom call, a prompt should appear that says “Converting meeting recording”

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Your video should be automatically saved once it’s processed to your Zoom folder on your computer. For details, follow this Zoom Documentation [Finding and viewing local recordings - Zoom Support](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206277393-Finding-and-viewing-local-recordings)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have a Free Zoom account, the video must be saved to your local computer. If you have a Zoom account with cloud recording support, your recording may be saved to your online Zoom account. For details and instructions on where to find and share these recordings, please follow the Zoom Documentation [Managing and sharing cloud recordings - Zoom Support](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205347605)
{% endhint %}

3\. Locate your recording on your computer and review the video to ensure the following:

* It captured your introduction
* It captured your entire attempt (the Zephyr simulator window was captured and you are able to see the entire drone operation)
* It captured your webcam during the entire attempt

4\. Upload the recording to a cloud storage service of your choosing. For example, Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, etc.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is not required, but it may be beneficial to transcode your video to a smaller size for uploading and storage. We recommend tools like [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) or [Adobe Media Encoder](https://www.adobe.com/products/media-encoder.html)

Note: the video resolution should be **no less than 1080p**
{% endhint %}

5. Once you have uploaded your recording to your cloud storage platform, retrieve a sharable link that you can submit to Zephyr for review

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure the link is **publicly accessible**. By default, many cloud storage platforms create your link private. You will need to make it **public** for Reviewers to access your attempt.
{% endhint %}

### Step 5: Submit Your Certification Attempt <a href="#step-5-submit-your-certification-attempt" id="step-5-submit-your-certification-attempt"></a>

Submit your attempt on the Zephyr website

1. Log in to your account on [Zephyr-Sim.com](http://zephyr-sim.com/) and navigate to your Certifications tab
2. Locate your Certification attempt in progress and select “Manage”
3. Paste the link to your video submission in the “Submission URL” box
4. Click SUBMIT

{% hint style="info" %}
Your Certification status will change to “In Review.” A proctor will review and update the submission as soon as possible. You will get a notification email when your submission has been reviewed
{% endhint %}

### Step 6: Await your Attempt to be Reviewed <a href="#step-6-await-your-attempt-to-be-reviewed" id="step-6-await-your-attempt-to-be-reviewed"></a>

A Reviewer will review your attempt and either approve, deny, or prompt a reattempt. You will receive email notifications throughout the entire certification review process.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your certification is denied or awaiting reattempt:

* Login to zephyr-sim.com
* Go to the CERTIFICATIONS tab
* Open the MY CERTIFICATIONS table
* Click the Options Cog icon on the certification entry
* Select "View"

There, you will be able to see the notes that the reviewer left
{% endhint %}
